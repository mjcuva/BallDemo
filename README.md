Balls of Fun
========

Messing with Gesture Recognizers and Core Animation in iOS.  Not extremely useful, just kinda fun.

Long press to grow a new ball, swipe to fling them around the screen, pinch and zoom to resize, and double tap to change color. A two finger swipe up clears the screen of balls.
